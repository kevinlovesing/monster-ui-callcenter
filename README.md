# monster-ui-callcenter (Cloudbased Callcenter GUI)
Based on the old Kazoo-UI app this provides a view of ACDC queues. It shows queues, all agents, ongoing calls and statistics.

Polling of stats has been disabled because it is a danger to the health of your system.

It will not win any prizes for beauty, functionality, elegance, code quality or usability. But we can't all be winners.
